# üì¨ Notification System

This project simulates a **Notification Management System** designed for sending notifications to users via different channels (e.g., Email, SMS), while handling **rate limiting**, **error simulation**, **user preferences**, and **extensibility** for future channels.

It consists of:

- `notification-manager`: The central service managing users, preferences, notification dispatching, rate-limiting, and error tracking.
- `notification-service`: A service that simulates the actual sending of notifications.
- `MongoDB`: Used to store dynamic notification documents and optionally user data.
- `Docker Compose`: For seamless orchestration of services.
- Written in **TypeScript** for type safety, scalability, and maintainability.

---

## üß† Assumptions

- A generic `/send` endpoint is exposed by `notification-manager`. After saving a notification to MongoDB, the manager calls the `notification-service` to deliver it via each enabled channel (`/send-email`, `/send-sms`).
- **MongoDB** is used for **notifications**, offering a dynamic schema that supports extensibility (adding channels or metadata per message).
- **Users** are stored in-memory for demo purposes, but in a production-grade system:
  - **Redis** would be used as a fast caching layer to fetch user preferences quickly.
  - Alternatively, user data could be persisted in a separate **MongoDB collection** or **SQL database** (like PostgreSQL).
- Rate-limiting and error tracking logic is designed with **Redis-style caching** in mind.
- Error and rate limit tracking is decoupled and extensible.

## üì¶ Features

### ‚úÖ Notification Dispatching
- Supports multiple channels per user (e.g., email and SMS simultaneously).
- Only dispatches to channels enabled in the user‚Äôs preferences.

### ‚ö° Rate Limiting
- Per-user and per-channel limits.
- Configurable via environment variables.
- Tracks the number of dispatches within a time window.
- Designed to be compatible with caching solutions like Redis.

### ‚ùå Error Simulation & Tracking
- Simulates a percentage of failed notification sends.
- All errors are tracked internally.
- Exposes API to monitor and reset error state.

### üë• User Preference Management
- Mocked users are loaded into the system on startup.
- In a real system, user data would be queried from Redis, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL.
- User preferences determine which channels receive notifications.

---

## üì° API Endpoints

### User
- `GET /users`: Lists all loaded users and their channel preferences.

### Notification
- `POST /send`: Dispatch a message based on user preferences.
  ```json
  {
    "recipient": "ironman@avengers.com",
    "message": "Suit up!"
  }


# Tests:
# Send a notification
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/send \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"recipient": "ironman@avengers.com", "message": "Hello from the API"}'

# View users
curl http://localhost:8080/users

# Check error tracker
curl http://localhost:8080/errors

# Reset error tracker
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/errors/reset
